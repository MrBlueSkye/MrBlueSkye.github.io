									<h2>A Brief History of BGP</h2>


									<p>The story of the Internet begins in the late 1960's, researchers at MIT have just succeeded in transferring data from one computer to another using a packet-switching technology, a precursor to IP as we know it. The magnitude of this feat was unfathomable, as within the next several years Government facilities all over America begin connecting and communicating with one another. By the early 1970's, technologies such as email were being introduced and the benefits of connecting to this large network became very attractive. Soon Universities worldwide join the movement, and the term "Internet" is born.</p>

									<p>Up until the early 1980's, the Internet had been relying on a simple distance-vector routing protocol called Gateway-to-Gateway Protocol, or GGP. GGP allowed routers to exchange databases of all IP subnets local to that device. The limitations of this protocol were beginning to show, and researchers began questioning the scalability of the protocol. By 1984, GGP was replaced with EGP, or Exterior Gateway Protocol. EGP introduced the concept of "Autonomous Systems", with a unique identifier being allocated to each Intranet connecting to NSFNET, which was the backbone of the Internet at the time.</p>

									<p>Around the same time, the TCP/IP Protocol suite was being developed, later emerging as the de-facto communication method for ARPANET. By the late 1980's, a successor to the EGP Routing Protocol was designed to make use of this new TCP transport technology. This was named Border Gateway Protocol. While still similar to the EGP distance-vector protocol, the Internet was growing at such a pace that automatic neighbor discovery was no longer feasible, so BGP now required manual neighbor specification. </p>

									<p>Over the next few years, BGP received several minor upgrades. The NSFNET backbone was being depreciated, and entities were desperate to connect directly to one-another, and so BGP Version 2 allowed for support of multiple paths to any given network. Unfortunately the protocol was still suffering major performance issues with scaling to support the exponentially growing number of networks on the Internet. BGP Version 3 aimed to fix these issues, but the re-issuing of a new Routing Protocol standard every few years was becoming increasingly problematic, and affecting the adoption rate. BGP was rewritten from the ground up with the future support for additional code to be added as optional extensions, or "Attributes". This was BGP Version 4, and is the same version used worldwide today! </p>

									<p>With a protocol foundation now globally adopted with the ability to mould parameters as you see fit, the industry began innovating to make the Internet what we see today. Class B IP ranges were become scarce, and many organizations were opting to advertise hundreds of Class C ranges instead. As such, the BGP Routing Table was growing extrememely large. Support for CIDR, or Classless Inter-Domain Routing, allowed BGP advertisements to summarize multiple Class C netoworks as a single entry in the Routing Table. BGP Communities allowed optional tags to be added to any route updates, allowing entities to influence how their traffic is handled by remote Autonomous Systems. Encrypted Authentication, IPv6 support and a host of other Attributes were added to the BGP specification, leading to the BGP Version 4 we know today.</p>


									<h2>An Introduction to BGP</h2>
									
									
									<p>BGP is a Path-Vector Routing Protocol. Similar to RIP, BGP uses hop-count as it's primary metric for finding the best route, but BGP uses hops between Autonomous Systems as opposed to hops between routers. Running over TCP Port 179, BGP is able to use TCP windowing to reliably exchange large databases of routes over the Internet. These databases contain routes for every network connected to the Internet, which at the time of writing stands at an incredulous 700,000 prefix entries! In Networking terms, this is the BGP Table, but many refer to it simply as the Internet Routing Table.</p>

									<p>Any router running BGP will receive a copy of this Table, but BGP Attributes allow for the filtering of routes, as well as the parameter modification of all prefixed received and advertised. When processing a mulitple routes to the same network, BGP will run the Best Path Selection Algorithm to select a route from it's BGP Table. The algorithm determines the best path by comparing each valid route based on BGP Attributes. The Attributes listed from highest to lowest Priority are as follows:

									</p>


											
									<dl>
														<h3>Weight</h3>
														<dd>
															<p><b>Action: </b>Prefer the path with the highest locally-configured WEIGHT</p>
															<p><b>Description: </b>WEIGHT is a Cisco-propreitary per-neighbor attribute that can be configured to priorise routes learned from specific neighbors.</p>
														</dd>
														<h3>Local Preference</h3>
														<dd>
															<p><b>Action: </b>Prefer the path with the highest locally-configured LOCAL_PREF.</p>
															<p><b>Description: </b>LOCAL_PREF is an attribute built into the BGP Standard and operates similarly to WEIGHT, however the Local Preference is configured locally on the actual router you would like to be preffered, not on a per-neighbor basis.</p>
														</dd>
														<h3>Locally Originated</h3>
														<dd>
															<p><b>Action: </b>Prefer the path that was locally originated via a network or aggregate BGP subcommand or through redistribution from an IGP.</p>
															<p><b>Description: </b>Any path that has been originated on a local router will be preferred over any paths learned from a BGP Peer. If no locally originated prefix exists in the BGP table for the paths being compared then this attribute is ignored.</p>
														</dd>
														<h3>AS Path</h3>
														<dd>
															<p><b>Action: </b>Prefer the path with the shortest AS_PATH.</p>
															<p><b>Description: </b>The original and the most fundamental attribute of BGP, the AS_PATH attribute stores a list of the BGP Automomous System numbers through which the route was learned. If AS1 advertises a route to AS2, the AS_PATH observed in AS2 would be "1". If AS2 then passes this UPDATE to AS3, AS3 would observe an AS_PATH of "1 2". As BGP routers will by default ignore any prefix updates with an AS_PATH attribute containing their own AS number, this attribute prevents routing loops occurring on the Internet for routes learned from multiple sources.</p>
														</dd>
														<h3>MED</h3>
														<dd>
															<p><b>Action: </b>Prefer the path with the lowest Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED)</p>
															<p><b>Description: </b>The MED, commonly reffered to as BGP Metric, is an optional, non-transitive attribute. This means that it is not enabled by default, and if it is enabled then the attribute will only be passed to immediate neighbors. If an AS has multiple connections to a neighboring AS, the MED allows BGP to directly which path we would like neighboring AS to route traffic to us over.</p>
														</dd>
														<h3>Network Type</h3>
														<dd>
															<p><b>Action: </b>Prefer routes learned through eBGP (External BGP) over iBGP (Internal BGP) routes.</p>
															<p><b>Description: </b>This attribute sets the BGP instance to make routing decisions solely based on the Internet Routing Table. It will only fall back to iBGP should a route entry not exist in the BGP Table.</p>
														</dd>
														<h3>Router ID (RID)</h3>
														<dd>
															<p><b>Action: </b>Prefer the route that comes from the BGP router with the lowest Router-ID.</p>
															<p><b>Description: </b>Every BGP Speaker is configured with a unique Router-ID. In private networks running iBGP, this will likely be a logical loopback IP address for enhanced resiliency. In eBGP, the Router-ID will be the external-facing Public IP Address of that router. </p>
														</dd>
														<h3>Neighbor IP</h3>
														<dd>
															<p><b>Action: </b>Prefer the path that comes from the lowest neighbor IP Address.</p>
															<p><b>Description: </b>If the Router-ID is the same for multiple routes in the BGP Table, this is indicitave that the routes were learned from the same neighbor. In this case, BGP will choose the lowest originating IP Address as a tie-breaker.</p>
														</dd>
									</dl>

									<h2>BGP Configuration</h2>
									
									
									<p>Here I am going to give a quick overview of some BGP configuration examples. I will be using the well-known Cisco IOS syntax, though the protocol-specific concepts remain true for any vendor.</p>

									<p>Now, to enable a base BGP configuration: </p>
